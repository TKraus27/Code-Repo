I've seen things you people wouldn't
believe. Attack ships on fire off the

glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user

in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

We have to chase him.
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.
So we'll hunt him.
Because he can take it.
Because he's not a hero.
He's a silent guardian.
A watchful protector.
A Dark Knight.

Message 1938:
You read the Bible, Brett? Well there's
this passage I got memorized, sorta fits
this occasion. Ezekiel 25:17? "The path
of the righteous man is beset on all sides
by the iniquities of the selfish and the
tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,
shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness, for he is truly is brother's
keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name is
the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
thee."

Message 2997:
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth
Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a
story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith
legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the
Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the
Force to influence the midichlorians to
create life...He had such a knowledge of the
dark side that he could even keep the once he
cared about from dying. The dark side of the
Force is a pathway to many abilities some
consider to be unnatural. He became so
powerful...The only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power. Which eventually, of course,
he did. Unfortunately, he taught his
apprentice everything he knew, then his
apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic,
he could have others from death, but not
himself.

and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity,
is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous
visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these
and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta
held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day
vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honour to meet
you and you may call me V.

Message 7469:
I've seen things you people wouldn't
believe. Attack ships on fire off the
shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams
glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user
Gate. All those moments will be lost
in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

Message 9949 (missing a packet):
We have to chase him.
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.
So we'll hunt him.
Because he can take it.
He's a silent guardian.
A watchful protector.
A Dark Knight.

a ternary logic simulator with graphical output in the style required by MP5.
This has been entirely rewritten and tested using a new simulation framework,
and then the file Gate.java has been removed.

Contents:
 README   -- this file
 classes  -- a list of all the class.java files in this program
 *.java   -- the source code
 testfile -- a file of input formatted for this code

To build this project, convert Gate.java to the new framework and then
use the following command line:
 javac @classes

To run this project on the test file use this command line:
 java TernaryLogic testfile 1 16
